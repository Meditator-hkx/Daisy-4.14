# Daisy-4.14

Upgrade the linux kernel to be 4.14 for further integration with filesystem and multi-mode 

Basic Method:
- Certify those files that have been added and modified in Daisy
- Add those files into Daisy-4.14

Challenges:
- File and Code lines might be missing during migration
- The difference between 3.11 and 4.14 may really affect the final result
